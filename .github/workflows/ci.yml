# This workflow ensures code quality and security:
# - Formatting: cargo fmt --check (Ubuntu only, platform-agnostic)
# - Linting: cargo clippy with -D warnings (Ubuntu only, platform-agnostic)
# - Security: cargo audit (all platforms)
# - Tests: All unit and integration tests (all platforms)
# - E2E: Ignored tests requiring network access (Ubuntu only, see e2e job)
# - Coverage: Code coverage via cargo-tarpaulin (uploaded to Codecov)
