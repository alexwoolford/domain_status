# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.21] - 2026-03-13

### Fixed
- **Panic on non-standard HTTP status codes**: Servers returning codes outside the standard range (e.g. HTTP 702 from `www.malichina.com`) caused `unwrap_err()` panic because reqwest's `error_for_status()` only returns `Err` for 400–599. Changed the 5xx check from `>= 500` to `500..600` so non-standard codes are processed as normal observations.

## [0.1.20] - 2026-03-12

### Fixed
- **UTF-8 panic in secret scanner**: `extract_context` panicked when byte arithmetic (`start - 80`) landed inside a multi-byte UTF-8 character (e.g. Polish `ę`). This crashed a 2-day scan at 3% through 873K URLs. Now uses `is_char_boundary()` scan to find safe slice points.
- **Documentation accuracy audit**: DATABASE.md, QUERIES.md, and README.md updated to match current schema (migrations 0001–0008). Added missing `url_jwt_claims` table, fixed duplicate query numbering, corrected library import path, added `skipped_urls` to run history queries, documented `UNIQUE(run_id, final_domain)` constraint.

### Added
- Regression test `test_context_multibyte_boundary_no_panic` to prevent future UTF-8 boundary panics in the secret scanner.

## [0.1.19] - 2026-03-12

### Added
- **OSINT Tier 1**: body SHA-256 hash, content-length, HTTP version, word/line count, content-type, canonical URL, certificate fingerprint SHA-256, redirect chain status codes per hop.
- **OSINT Tier 2**: CNAME records, AAAA (IPv6) addresses, CAA (Certificate Authority Authorization) records. All stored in normalized satellite tables.
- **OSINT Tier 3**: CSP domain extraction, cookie security analysis (Secure/HttpOnly/SameSite), meta refresh detection, preconnect/dns-prefetch resource hints, body FQDN extraction (using scraper HTML parser, not regex), certificate intelligence (serial number, self-signed/wildcard/mismatched detection).
- New satellite tables: `url_cname_records`, `url_ipv6_addresses`, `url_caa_records`, `url_csp_domains`, `url_cookies`, `url_resource_hints`, `url_body_domains`.
- Structured `TechnologyRecord` and `AnalyticsIdRecord` in JSONL export (avoids comma/colon delimiter corruption).
- Reference repos: cloned `cdncheck` and `dnsx` for future CDN detection work.

### Fixed
- **4xx responses now processed as successes**: 403 Forbidden (WAF/bot detection) pages are fully scanned instead of discarded. Only 429 and 5xx trigger the failure/retry path.
- **Drain timeout accounting**: in-flight tasks aborted during shutdown are now counted as failed instead of silently dropped (91+9=100, not 89+7=96).
- **Stale satellite data on UPSERT**: all 26 satellite/enrichment tables are now cleaned before re-inserting, preventing corrupted merges when the same domain is rescanned.
- **Regex ternary `\10` corruption**: `replace_placeholders` now iterates in reverse (high to low), matching `extract_version_from_template`.
- **Regex pattern destruction**: `.to_lowercase()` was applied to Wappalyzer regex patterns, converting `\S` to `\s` and `\D` to `\d`. Now only header/cookie keys are lowercased.
- **CSV column misalignment**: data array order now matches header order for all 84 columns.
- **TXT record truncation panic**: byte-index slicing replaced with `.chars().take(N)` to respect UTF-8 boundaries.
- **WHOIS cache quota bypass**: counter now seeded from actual directory size on restart.
- **Certificate mismatch false positives**: comparison used already-drained SAN list (always empty). Now uses the correct `sans_vec`.
- **NULL registrable_domain**: bare PSL suffixes (e.g., `akamaihd.net`) now fall back to the FQDN itself.
- **Percent-encoded contact values**: `tel:` and `mailto:` hrefs are now URL-decoded.
- **Resource hints stored raw URLs**: now stores clean hostnames only.
- **Double/triple DOM parse**: body domain extraction and mobile-friendliness check now reuse the existing DOM tree.
- **JSON-LD regex recompilation**: two complex regexes now compiled once via `static LazyLock`.
- **Unbounded text allocation**: `.collect()` on full page text replaced with iterator early termination.
- **Status server double-counted skipped URLs**: `processed = completed + failed` (completed already includes skipped).
- **Ctrl-C cancellation**: active HTTP requests now aborted immediately via `tokio::select!` instead of waiting for drain timeout.
- **Export data trapped**: Tier 3 satellite counts (CSP, cookies, hints, body domains) now fetched from DB instead of hardcoded 0.

### Removed
- `sample_100.txt` and `public_companies.txt` removed from git tracking (user-specific data).

## [0.1.18] - 2026-03-11

### Changed
- SSRF: consolidate private IP checks into `url_validation`; add missing ranges (CGNAT 100.64.0.0/10, benchmarking 198.18.0.0/15, IETF 192.0.0.0/24, documentation 192.0.2.0/24, 198.51.100.0/24, 203.0.113.0/24). `safe_resolver` now uses shared `is_private_ip`.
- Retry logic: replace fragile string matching in `is_retriable_error` with typed `hickory_resolver::ResolveError` downcast for DNS; rely on `reqwest::Error::status()` for HTTP.
- ProcessingStats: use `enum_map::EnumMap` instead of `HashMap<ErrorType, AtomicUsize>`; consistent `Ordering::Relaxed` for stats.
- Hot path: use `Ordering::Relaxed` for independent atomic counters in run/task.
- Task handlers: reduce argument count via `TaskProgress` struct; remove `clippy::too_many_arguments` suppressions.
- Redirect chain: O(1) check `chain.last() != Some(&last_fetched_url)` instead of `chain.contains()`.
- HTTP client: tune pool_idle_timeout, pool_max_idle_per_host, tcp_nodelay for scanning.
- SQLite: set `PRAGMA synchronous=NORMAL` with WAL mode.

## [0.1.17] - 2026-03-10

### Changed
- CI: remove unused `FORCE_JAVASCRIPT_ACTIONS_TO_NODE24` env var (no effect on Node 20 deprecation warnings).

## [0.1.16] - 2026-03-09

### Security
- Fix RUSTSEC-2026-0037: update `quinn-proto` 0.11.13 → 0.11.14 (DoS in Quinn endpoints, severity 8.7).

### Changed
- Remove redundant `webpki-roots` dependency (already transitive via reqwest).
- Move tokio `test-util` feature to dev-dependencies (not needed in release builds).
- Replace `panic!` with `log::error!` in failure recording to prevent scan crashes on transient DB errors.

## [0.1.15] - 2026-03-09

### Changed
- Multi-channel release: version bump for GitHub, Homebrew, and Crates.io distribution.

## [0.1.14] - 2026-03-08

### Added
- Impactful adversarial and boundary tests for run/task, cli, favicon, geoip, fetch/handler, and vendor whois-service (contracts, failure paths, threshold boundaries).

### Changed
- **Timing fields**: Internal duration fields renamed from `_ms` to `_us` where they store microseconds (`UrlTimingMetrics`, `TimingStats`, and status server timing). Epoch/timestamp columns (e.g. `start_time_ms`, `observed_at_ms`) remain in milliseconds; no database migration. Public API (e.g. `/status` JSON) still reports times in milliseconds.

## [0.1.12] - 2026-03-02

### Added
- **Contact extraction**: Extract email addresses and phone numbers from `mailto:` and `tel:` links in HTML. New `url_contact_links` table with deduplication.
- **Exposed secret detection**: Scan HTML for ~57 credential patterns across 13 categories (AWS, OpenAI, Anthropic, Stripe, Slack, GitHub, GitLab, database URLs, private keys, and many more). Each finding includes:
  - **Severity classification** (critical/high/medium/low) based on impact
  - **Location heuristic** (inline_script, html_comment, data_attribute, url_parameter, meta_tag, html_body)
  - **80-character context window** for analyst triage
  - Full matched values stored (no redaction — these are on the public web)
- New `url_exposed_secrets` table with severity and location columns
- **Homebrew tap**: `brew tap alexwoolford/domain-status && brew install domain_status`
- Per-domain rate limiting (`--max-per-domain`) to prevent overwhelming individual servers
- Parquet export format with Apache Arrow typed columns
- Complete export data: all satellite table data now included in CSV/JSONL/Parquet exports

### Fixed
- `.gitignore` `secrets.*` pattern was blocking `secrets.rs` source files
- Flaky `test_regex_cache_works` timing assertion on macOS CI runners
- Retry default changed to fail-fast for unknown errors (was incorrectly retrying)

## [0.1.11] - 2026-02-18

### Added

- Removed 7 low-value tests that only tested Rust derive macros (Debug, Clone, Default)
- Improved test quality: removed coverage padding, focused on genuinely valuable test cases
- Updated README.md to reflect new subcommand structure

### Fixed
- Fixed clippy warnings (use `&Path` instead of `&PathBuf`, remove needless borrows, use arrays instead of `vec!`)
- Fixed test compilation errors and improved test reliability
