# domain_status
**domain_status** is a Rust-based tool designed for multithreaded checking of URL statuses and redirections. It captures errors, tracks progress, and records results in a SQLite database.

## üåü Features

* **Speedy Execution**: Utilizes multithreading to process URLs rapidly.
* **Accurate Monitoring**: Keeps track of various connection and DNS issues.
* **Comprehensive Reports**: Provides regular status updates and a detailed error summary after execution.
* **Data Storage**: Saves results to a SQLite database for easy access and further analysis.
* **Domain Insights**: Extracts domains from URLs and captures critical data like final domain after redirection.

## üîß Getting Started

### Building
To get started, first build the project:

    cargo build --release

This creates an executable in the ./target/release/ directory.

### Usage
Run the tool with a list of URLs:

    domain_status urls.txt

## Database Details
The results are stored in the domain_results.db SQLite database, inside a table named `url_status`. Each entry in this table consists of:

| Field                   | Type      | Description                                                                                                                                                                            |
