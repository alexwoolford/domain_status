# Cargo configuration for the domain_status project

[env]
# Suppress logs during tests for clean, professional test output
# This prevents expected error/warning logs from cluttering test results
# Override for debugging: RUST_LOG=debug cargo test
# Note: force = false allows override via command line or environment variable
RUST_LOG = { value = "off", force = false }
